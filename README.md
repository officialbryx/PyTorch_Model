# PyTorch_Model
Developing a predictive model for future purposes (probably thesis-related). (Note: I'll edit this ASAP) 

Tools used: NVIDIA CUDA 12.6 (for machine learning purposes), Visual Studio Code
Package Libraries used: 
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 (CUDA version 11.8)

Summarization:
1.) Vector - is a quantity with magnitude and direction.
2.) Tensor - matrices of vectors to organize and store data in machine learning.
